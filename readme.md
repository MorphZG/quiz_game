# Quizzler App

## Introduction

The Quizzler App is a Python project aimed at practicing APIs and object-oriented programming principles. This project revisits a previous project built using classes and OOP, integrating API requests and a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter module.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to fetch trivia questions from an API.
- As a user, I want to see these questions presented in a GUI.
- As a user, I want to be able to answer the questions and receive feedback.

## Instructions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or above).
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

### Running the Program

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the `main.py` file using Python: `python main.py`.
3. The Quizzler App GUI will appear, displaying trivia questions.
4. Answer the questions by clicking the corresponding "True" or "False" buttons.
5. Receive feedback on your answers in the console.

## How the Program Works

1. **API Integration:** The program fetches trivia questions from an API endpoint (<https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=boolean>) using the `requests` module.

2. **HTML Entities Handling:** The retrieved data may contain HTML entities, which are unescaped using the `html.unescape()` method from the `html` module to ensure proper display in the GUI.

3. **Class-based Tkinter GUI:** The GUI is constructed using the Tkinter module. Each class in the project corresponds to a separate module. The GUI-related functionality is encapsulated within the `QuizInterface` class in the `ui.py` module.

4. **Interactions between Modules:** The `QuizBrain` class manages the quiz, including fetching questions, tracking scores, and checking answers. It communicates with the GUI through the `QuizInterface` class, passing question data and handling user responses.

5. **User Feedback:** Upon answering a question in the GUI, feedback is provided in the console. This feedback is generated by calling the `check_answer()` method from the `QuizBrain` class and passing the user's response.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance error handling for API requests.
- Expand the range of trivia questions and categories.
- Implement additional features such as timers or multiple-choice questions.
